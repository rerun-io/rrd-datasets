# MolmoAct2

## Local Runs

The source data revision is pinned in this example.
Bump `HF_REVISION` in [`molmoact2/episode_index.py`](molmoact2/episode_index.py) to pick up newer episodes.

### 1. Download

Download the dataset's `meta/` folder (72 MB) and three sample file groups (~1.1 GB, 19 episodes) into `data/MolmoAct2/`.
The dataset stores many episodes in each video file, so the samples are file groups: runs of consecutive episodes whose files hold no other episode.

```bash
pixi run -e molmo download
```

To download different file groups, edit `SAMPLES` in [`molmoact2/download.py`](molmoact2/download.py).

The downloader caches a listing of the whole repo in `.cache/hf_files.json.gz`.
Building it takes a while on the first run, and it is rebuilt when the dataset revision changes.
